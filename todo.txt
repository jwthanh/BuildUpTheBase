* everything costs the same

#Items icons
* Canary
* Map
* Light lamp
* Spellbook
* Pickaxe
* Magic Staff
* Woodsman (lumberjack)
* Artisan (item type 'crafting')

#Bugs and stuff
* borders to ui panels
* Popup panel closing
* digging altar and start pos overlaps DONE but write a better fix
* checkout advanced and basic bottom ingredient listviews along bottom
* animate adding a new resource from the sidebar, like minecarts or healing DONE but improve it later
* make sure vibration isnt overused

#Features
* Stats screen
    * Dynamic class ala Dungeon Siege
* Info panel for building with misc stats, how many fighters killed, their
  damage etc
* Item shop, put up an item, maybe in a few hours someone would come and buy it
    * Can upgrade shop to:
        * have more slots
        * have better idea of customers

#Workers
* sell more than 1000 at a time #DONE
* buy more than one harvester at a time

* trade resources in for others, catan style
* sell workers back

* toggle all workers  on or off
* can recruit specialized harvesters to live in your city. they either live a certain amount of time
  or require a certain resource before leaving or reducing output
* when you find these special ones, you can either use them right away, or put them in a training are for a X time
  and then name them on the way out and they get special bonuses

* dont pause application on background, maybe do the post load on return


#Equipment
* equipment screen for items, slots for combat stuff, harvest stuff.
* equipment is limited by character level
* character level is boosted in combat, (or by doing other things?)

* find things in the mine that aren't the altar, but are little pickups along the way


* special harvesters require resources per second (to make use of generators)

#Items
* limited slots, so you can have one dagger type, but you can replace it for a better one
* items have passives #DONE
* limited slots for total item inventory

* new welcome-back prompt so it "doesn't look like a programmers console"

* limit the amount of levels you can upgrade technologies by. its too high and salesmen are out of control

* since we've got items now, lets turn sword sharpening into a timer and have it degrade all the time
* Need a progress bar that shows the sword sharpness

#Misc UI
* Better user messaging
* Changelog in app
* tips on how to play

#Questing
* daily quests
* daily chest to open where you can find something special and maybe limit the other ways you can do stuff

* UserProfile proxy. a lot of the time I'm hitting the disk to check for a
  single flag. might be worth looking into a nice way to pull all that out into
  memory and then saving that state to disk every so often instead, sort of
  like coins

* Analytics and user tracking

#WALLET
To increase wallet size you need to sell items to the marketplace, accumulating value as you sell
* items sell their value
* stored value resets after item purchas
* potential for upgrades for keeping leftover money

#DARK SALESMEN
Can fuse two items together with scrolls that contain blueprints

# grave robbing
* can curse you, combat gets harder, or you take damage
* can find better items or treasure
* potential for upgrades


# theme ideas
you start off as garbage out of a spaceships ejection chute and then grow into your own lifeform then end by taking over the world
 what if instead, it was a black hole and every time you get to the core (temple)  you went to another universe or something
 Then the people you fight could be kings and warriors from other galaxies,
 you slowly are collecting rare items that will help you take over
 it'd give you sections to work through. different planets would have
  different types to it. you could switch between planets to focus on different
  strategies and weaknesses or something. I'll write the idea down
