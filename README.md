## Technical considerations and tools
* Native 960*640@60fps is targeted on Windows and Android, no hard plans for iOS but should be fine after a few tweaks
* Cocos2dx for rendering and display
* easylogging for error handling
* rapidjson for save files
* Magic Particles for a souped up particle system
* Time-based cheat detection

## Release Date

Aiming Summer 2017
