* equipment is limited by character level
* character level is boosted in combat, (or by doing other things?)

* find things in the mine that aren't the altar, but are little pickups along the way

* can recruit specialized harvesters to live in your city. they either live a certain amount of time
  or require a certain resource before leaving or reducing output
* when you find these special ones, you can either use them right away, or put them in a training are for a X time
  and then name them on the way out and they get special bonuses

* special harvesters require resources per second (to make use of generators)

* limited slots, so you can have one dagger type, but you can replace it for a better one

* new welcome-back prompt so it "doesn't look like a programmers console"

* limit the amount of levels you can upgrade technologies by. its too high and salesmen are out of control

* since we've got items now, lets turn sword sharpening into a timer and have it degrade all the time
* Need a progress bar that shows the sword sharpness

* Better user messaging
* Changelog in app
* tips on how to play

* daily quests

* UserProfile proxy. a lot of the time I'm hitting the disk to check for a
  single flag. might be worth looking into a nice way to pull all that out into
  memory and then saving that state to disk every so often instead, sort of
  like coins

# theme ideas
you start off as garbage out of a spaceships ejection chute and then grow into your own lifeform then end by taking over the world
 what if instead, it was a black hole and every time you get to the core (temple)  you went to another universe or something
 Then the people you fight could be kings and warriors from other galaxies,
 you slowly are collecting rare items that will help you take over
 it'd give you sections to work through. different planets would have
  different types to it. you could switch between planets to focus on different
  strategies and weaknesses or something. I'll write the idea down
