# BaseBuilder
An upcoming game about building a base

## Features
None yet

## Release Schedule

* Way too early to tell

# Installation (roughly)
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/filedown/cocos2d-x-3.4.zip should be the same one I use now, although I got it right off of github.

# iOS and Mac

1. clone this repo
2. install cocos2d-x
3. create new game (cocos new Temp -p com.Temp -l cpp -d .)
4. copy the cocos2d folder into the root of the 'artistry' folder
